/**
 * @file tal_event_info.h
 * @brief Defines system-wide events for Tuya IoT applications.
 *
 * This header file lists constants for various system and application events
 * that can be used within Tuya IoT applications to handle specific actions like
 * device reboot requests, LAN client disconnections, MQTT connectivity changes,
 * and more. These events facilitate communication and state management across
 * different components of Tuya IoT applications, enabling a responsive and
 * dynamic environment.
 *
 * Applications can subscribe to or publish these events as needed, allowing for
 * modular and decoupled design. This file is an essential part of the Tuya IoT
 * Development Platform, providing developers with predefined events that cover
 * common IoT scenarios.
 *
 * @note This file should be included in projects that require interaction with
 * Tuya IoT Platform events.
